# Customer Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text. This project leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained models from Hugging Face to analyze and predict the sentiment of customer reviews. The models used in this project are fine-tuned on sentiment classification tasks to provide accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models**: We use pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, etc., from Hugging Face Transformers. These models have been fine-tuned on sentiment analysis datasets, providing robust performance.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, padding, and truncation of input text to prepare it for model consumption.
- **Customizable**: Easily swap out the pre-trained models or fine-tune new ones according to specific requirements.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PynaPavani/customer-review-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd customer-review-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
  install independencies which are required like transformers, huggingface using pip.
   ```

3. **Run the Model**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Results

The implemented models achieve notable accuracy and can be further fine-tuned to adapt to specific datasets or requirements. The results include the classification of reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, along with the corresponding confidence scores.
